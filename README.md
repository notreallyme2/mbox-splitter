# mbox-splitter

I downloaded all my emails (going back 10 years) from gmail (I don't like them having such a large volume of private information).
The resulting .mbox file was too large to handle easily (8 GB).

mbox-splitter splits mbox files by year and saves them in the same location as individual mbox files, named **YEAR.mbox**.

I've included a binary for OSX.


### Correct useage
`mbox-splitter -f=PATH_TO_FILE`
